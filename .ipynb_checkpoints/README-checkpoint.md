Your data team has decided to move outside of the consultation business and into creating its own app! After months of brainstorming and market research you finally identify a gap in the market. You pitch the idea for the app "SeeFood". It's Shazam for food. You get funded immediately. Time to get to work!

## Deliverables

* A model that predicts whether a new image is a hot dog or not.
* A prototype Streamlit app where a user can upload a picture. Your app will display whether a Hot Dog is present or not. 
* A very quick presentation or demo of your app - under 5 minutes.


## Data

## Tips
* Start with a basic network architecture, you can add image augmentation and transfer learning as time allows.
* Save your best model to a file and load it into your Streamlit app.
* You might want to have someone focus on building the Streamlit app relatively early in the process.
* In your presentation, tell us your model's improvement over baseline.
* TensorFlow's [ImageDataGenerator class](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/image/ImageDataGenerator) can help you load your data.
* Make sure you use a GPU for any CNNs! Kaggle has GPUs available (and maybe TPUs - even faster, but might require code modification). You can choose the upgraded hardware under *Settings* -> *Accelerator*. You may need to register and confirm some information first. ðŸ™‚
